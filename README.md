# SRAM-RTL-Design
This project implements a parameterized synchronous SRAM using Verilog. The design supports configurable address and data widths, synchronous read and write operations, and reset functionality. A self-checking testbench verifies correct memory behavior, and simulation results are validated using waveform analysis in EDA Playground.
